My name is Christian but my friend use to call me **Geo**.

I am a **Chemist** and i work in a **technological lab** on the field of **wood and furniture:** [COSMOB](http://www.cosmob.it). 
More or less a **year ago** the structure decided to create a **Fablab**: we named it [Fablab Pesaro](https://it-it.facebook.com/FablabPesaro). Since then i was working on this project and finally on March 13 2015 we will open it to the world.

I am natural curious man and **my interest are wide**: from basic science to manual handwork passing through electronics and nature.

My **curiosity** brings me to know a bit of stuff about many arguments but i think that i don't know anything in a deep manner.
I hope that this knowledge journey in the Fabacademy 2015 help me to join the dots and design a complete picture from this dots.

My time is limited because of my work and my beautiful family but i hope that with diligence and enthusiasm i can perform a **joyfull journey into the science and art of building things**.
