My name is Christian but my friends are wont to call me **Geo**.

I am a **Chemist** and i work in a **technological lab** on the field of **wood and furniture:** [COSMOB](http://www.cosmob.it). 
More or less a **year ago** me and a couple of friends decided to propose to the direction of COSMOB to create a **Fablab** powered by the structure.
The idea was accepted and the project started to grow.
We named the project [Fablab Pesaro](https://it-it.facebook.com/FablabPesaro). Since then i was working on this project and finally on March 13 2015 what was a project will become a real Fablab.

I am a "natural curious man" and **my interests are varied**: from basic science to manual handwork passing through electronics and nature.

My **curiosity** brings me to know a bit of stuff about many arguments but i think that i don't know anything in a depth manner. At this moment i think that my knowledges are like a set of separate dots.
I like to think to the Fabacademy like a journey in the knowledge and i hope that this journey help me to connect the dots and design a complete picture from these dots.

The time that i can dedicate to Fabacademy is limited because of my work and of my beautiful family but i hope that with diligence and enthusiasm i can still take a **fulfilling journey into the science and art of building things**.
