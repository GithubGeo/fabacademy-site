My name is Christian but my friend use to call me Geo. I am a Chemist and i work in a technological lab on the field of wood and furniture [COSMOB](http://www.cosmob.it).
I am natural curious man and my interest are wide: from basic science to manual handwork passing through electronics and nature.
My curiosity brings me to know a bit of stuff about many arguments but i don't know anything in a deep manner.
I hope that this knowledge journey in the Fabacademy 2015 help me to join the spots and build a complete picture.
My time is limited because of my work and my beautiful family but i hope that with diligence and enthusiasm i can perform a joyfull journey into the science and art of building things.
