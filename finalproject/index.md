## The concept

The idea of the my final project is to realize an air filter that can improve the quality of the pulluted air that can be found inside a room.
The problem of the pollution inside our building is well known and usuallly is tackle in a "mechanical ways".
I would like to approach the problem using the best filter known in the world: plants. Also this information is well known but i think that also plants need an improuvement: in particular augmenting the capacity to intercept polluted air.

This is why i tough to merge the mechanical approch and the plant approch in my final project.
So i want to build a filter utilizing plants that are stored in a transparent geodesic dome. In the base of this dome i want to put the mechanical ventilation system that is active only when a sensor out of the dome reveal a high level of VOC pollutant.
This is a preliminary sketchs:
