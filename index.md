Hi,
my name is Christian and i am a student of the Fabacademy 2015 at [Fablab Cascina](http://fablabcascina.org).
I am very excited because my journey into the knowledge of making things is about to begin.
I here at the Fablab Cascina after three hours of car journey (from Pesaro to Pisa) with my traveling companions waiting the first connection with Neil.

I am sure that will be a good journey and i hope to live up to this experience.
