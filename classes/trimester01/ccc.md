## Introduction
The assignements of this week is to realize a press fit kit using a lasercutter and a cardboard.

## Learning path
The idea to accomplish this assignement is to realize a toy with the technique of press fit. In particular i want to realize a 3d puzzle dinosaur for my children.
I am not familiar with laser cutting and press fit kit so my approach is to realize something simple in the first time that could help me to explore this technique. In a second time i want to use this technique to realize the box for my final project
