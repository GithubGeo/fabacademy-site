## Introduction
 Assignement: design and print one object, 3d scan and print the object that you scanned. 


## Learning path

For the first assignement i want to design a special joint that is utilized to build some DIY geodetic dome. I want to reproduce i design that fit to my need of building a geodesic dome to cover my filter for my final project.
Here the photo of that joint:

My design ability is not so good so i attemp to approach this task using Openscad. In fact i think that with simple formula i can reproduce the design of the joint because it is based on geometric form that are repeated with simple simmetry.
Here the result:

For the printing of this joint i used two 3d printer to compare the results. The first one is a Delta Wasp 20x40 and the second is a Falla3D. They are two kind of
