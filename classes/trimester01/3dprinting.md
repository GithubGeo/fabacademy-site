## Introduction
 Assignement: design and print one object, 3d scan and print the object that you scanned. 

## Learning path

### 3D printing

- I want to project something usefull but little enough to be printed in short time
- These are the ideas: an holding glass for the bed of my son, a cover for my garden lamp, a stuff for my old car.
- I decided to proced with two object: the stuff for my car and the cover lamp.

***The stuff for my old car:***
- Simple design
- Little objects = small printing time
- Problem: thin object that need a brim base to be printed correctly

***The cover for my garden lamp***
- Some usefull measure of the lamp that i want to cover with a diffusor system
- The sketch of the project
- The final design with solidworks: various versions
- And finally 3d printing and it's problem

### 3D scanning

I used inect sensor with skanect to perform various scan: people, object and room.
Then i decided to try to reconstruct a 3d model from a series of slices images of medical radiography using Osirix. After some funny test on my wristle radiography i found a tutorial (see instructable) where it was indicated how to rebuild a dinosaur skull from a series of dicom micro CT. I decided to follow this tutorial and print the euplocefalus skul for my son. This is the results.  

## Application to my final project

For the first assignement i want to design a special joint that is utilized to build some DIY geodetic dome. I want to reproduce i design that fit to my need of building a geodesic dome to cover my filter for my final project.
Here the photo of that joint:

My design ability is not so good so i attemp to approach this task using Openscad. In fact i think that with simple formula i can reproduce the design of the joint because it is based on geometric form that are repeated with simple simmetry.
Here the result:

For the printing of this joint i used two 3d printer to compare the results. The first one is a Delta Wasp 20x40 and the second is a Falla3D. They are two kind of
