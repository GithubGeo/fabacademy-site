## Introduction

Two ideas on the molding week: realize something with chocolate and realize something with metal. 


## Learning path

***Something with chocolate***
I want to realize a Yoda bon bon (lego version). 
- I started with Sketch up designing the body of my lego Yoda.
- Then i tried to assemble a Thingiverse model with the Yoda head in my yoda body.
- Ater that i imported the .stl file in the software of the Roland SRM-20
- These are the settings.

***Something with metal***
I want to realize a little jewel for my wife. I started from the idea that the object had to be something unique and something personal. I think about on it and the idea was to create a pendant starting from the scan of my finger print.
- First operation: fixing on a papersheet my finger using common ink
- Then i scanned the paper and working with the image i tried to obtain a texture usable for my need
- Following this [tutorial](http://blog.cubehero.com/2013/11/11/how-to-generate-extruded-3d-model-from-images-in-openscad/) i tried to extrude the image obtain a solid object
